Certainly! Implementing login and registration functionality using React.js and MongoDB involves several steps. 
Let’s break it down:

Setting Up Your React App:
  * Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
  * Create a new React app using the following command:
  * npx create-react-app expengo -y
    
Install required dependencies:
  * npm install realm-web react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react

Project Structure:
* Create the following directories and files in your project:
├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── Home.page.js
│   │   ├── PrivateRoute.page.js
│   │   ├── Login.page.js
│   │   └── Signup.page.js
│   ├── contexts/
│   │   └── user.context.js
│   └── realm/
│       └── constants.js
├── App.js
└── ...

Connect to MongoDB Atlas:
  * Set up MongoDB Atlas and configure your backend to connect to it.
  * Use Realm Web SDK to interact with MongoDB Atlas from your React app.

Authentication Flow:
  * Create components for login, signup, and home pages.
  * Use React Router to manage navigation.
  * Implement user context to manage user state.
  * Create a private route component (PrivateRoute.page.js) to protect routes that require authentication.

Login and Signup:
  * In Login.page.js and Signup.page.js, create forms to collect user input (email and password).
  * Use Realm authentication APIs to handle login and signup requests.
  * Store the user’s JWT token in local storage.

Logout:
  * Implement a logout function to clear the JWT token from local storage.

Error Handling:
  * Handle errors from the server and database appropriately.
